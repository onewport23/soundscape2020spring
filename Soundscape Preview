This soundscape preview contains the major sounds that I will be using to develop my narrative. To provide a summary of what I explained in my initial soundscape proposal, I intend to create an audio story of a person hiking to the top of an overlook. I hope that the sounds that I use demonstrate the physical toll that it takes to ascend a mountain/hill, and the reward that is ultimately achieved when you reach the top. To develop this narrative, I have started to pull together various audio files. These sounds include: walking on a trail, a dog barking, drinking from a water bottle, eating an apple, birds chirping, and heavy breathing. At this point, I have personally recorded the water drinking audio and heavy breathing audio. These can be heard in the .aup preview that I have attached. I've started to organize the placement of some of the clips, but as I continue to learn how to navigate Audacity, I need to reassess the order to determine what works best for the narrative.  

Next Steps: 
- record reaction copy for the end of the clip, when the final view is first enjoyed
- record audio of eating an apple to see how it compares with found audio
- arrange clips in a strategic order 
- play with the audio gains for each clip to emphasize certain sounds over others

Questions Moving Forward: 
- At what point is the person drinking water? Eating an apple? 
- Is the dog barking at something or is it just excited (as I have seen them react when walking on a trail)? 
- Should the walking audio cut out when the hiker is eating/drinking?
- Is there any other noise that people associate with a trail hike? 
- What do you say when you see an amazing view?
