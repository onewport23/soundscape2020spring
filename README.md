Prompt for a soundscape narrative for Ben Miller's course in Composing Digital Media

For my soundscape narrative I wanted to create a listening experience that features an activitiy that I have participated in several times, and is something that I personally have vivid auditory associations with. For this reason, I chose to call my narrative: "Hiking to the Top," which refers to a forest hike that takes you to a higher, aerial overlook of a valley or gorge. I have a specific trail that I frequent with my family and dog at home that inspired this narrative. My objective with this soundscape is for listeners to appreciate the beautiful parts of a journey to a location, and the satisfying, yet quieter destination. I believe that the sublte sounds scattered throughout the soundscape create a realistic experience for the listener, and hopefully allow them to visualize themselves on my favorite trail, or even better, their own favorite hike.
